Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
An inline element does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of the page, a block element does. Also, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements. You can not put black elements inside inline elements.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
 An absolutely positioned element is positioned based off the body element position and is not affected by the normal document layout flow.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
Set the position to relative and padding margin to auto but set your desired width with %
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Display block by default: <p> <div> <address>
Display inline by default: <button> <img>
Display inline-block by default: <box>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

The box is really four boxes inside one another. The innermost box is where our data, or content, goes. Next out we have our padding, then border, and finally margin. The fix for making the elements respect width is to define the min-width, max-width, width, min-height, and max-height.
